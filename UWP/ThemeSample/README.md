# Theme Sample
This sample demonstrates how to support dynamic color and shape themes in UWP. It's an update to a Channel 9 video I did long ago on [creating skins for WPF](https://channel9.msdn.com/blogs/jbienz/skins-for-wpf-and-silverlight). That video still mostly applies to this sample except that UWP doesn't support DynamicResource and the new ThemeResource markup extension only works for Dark, Light and High Contrast themes. The workaround is to dynamically replace the resources in the main resource dictionary and then reload the page. Obviously this isn't a fashionable approach, but it's workable for many applications.
